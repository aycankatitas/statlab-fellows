## StatLab/Data for Democracy Fellows

Fellows will be working across the StatLab portfolio this year, contributing to our data analytics consultatino and training and advancing the Data for Democracy Public Presidency project.

* For Data Analytics: Fellows will deepen their knowledge of quantitative methods, data analysis and data science, and statistical computation by working collaboratively with statistical and data science experts, supporting data science research on grounds through consultations with researchers across disciplinary boundaries, writing online instructional materials and articles, and developing and teaching an instructional workshop.
 
* For Data for Democracy: Fellows will have the opportunity to deepen their knowledge of quantitative methods, data analysis and data science, and statistical computation by working collaboratively on a public interest data science project, contributing intellectually and methodologically; practicing open and reproducible data science workflows using tools like R, Python, GitHub, and Overleaf; communicating about the work through blog posts, research articles, and presentations.
