## New features from project_tasks

* Lexicoder Sentiment Dictionary: [Affective News: The Automated Coding of Sentiment in Political Texts](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10584609.2012.671234) -- link should work if you're on the UVA network or the VPN
* Lexicoder Topic Dicionary: [The Automated Coding of Policy Agendas: A Dictionary-Based Approach] (http://www.lexicoder.com/docs/CAP2013v2.pdf)
* Wordfish ideological scores: [A Scaling Model for Estimating Time-Series Party Positions from Texts.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25193842) -- need to be on UVA network or VPN
* Laver-Garry Wordstat scores: [Estimating Policy Positions from Political Texts](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2669268) -- need to be on UVA network of VPN

## [Quanteda](https://docs.quanteda.io/index.html) resources

The quanteda guides and examples are a good start both for learning the functionality in the package and for understanding some of the more common text analysis procedures.

* [Quick start guide](https://docs.quanteda.io/articles/quickstart.html)
* [Package design](https://docs.quanteda.io/articles/pkgdown/design.html), for a big picture view of the package
* [Examples](https://docs.quanteda.io/index.html), several are available from the tab at the top and are worth checking out!

## Sentiment analysis

* [Nice overview](https://monkeylearn.com/sentiment-analysis/) of main approaches
* [SentimentR](https://github.com/trinker/sentimentr), for a variation on the lexicon-based approach incorporating valence shifters
* [Application](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0002716215569217) of a variation on the lexicon-based approach moving beyond polarity (positive-negative)
* [Past workshop](http://static.lib.virginia.edu/statlab/materials/workshops/sentimentMaterials.zip) on sentiment analysis in R

There are other sources I'd point to for the machine learning approach, but as the algorithms are often built on specific corpora (e.g., social media, moview reviews, etc.), generalizability is always a question. Of course, generalizability is in quesiton for lexicons, as well, but lexicons are simpler to adapt for a domain/corpus-type. So let's start there.
