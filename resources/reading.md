## [Quanteda](https://docs.quanteda.io/index.html) resources

The quanteda guides and examples are a good start both for learning the functionality in the package and for understanding some of the more common text analysis procedures.

* [Quick start guide](https://docs.quanteda.io/articles/quickstart.html)
* [Package design](https://docs.quanteda.io/articles/pkgdown/design.html), for a big picture view of the package
* [Examples](https://docs.quanteda.io/index.html), several are available from the tab at the top and are worth checking out!

## Sentiment analysis

* [Nice overview](https://monkeylearn.com/sentiment-analysis/) of three main approaches
* [SentimentR](https://github.com/trinker/sentimentr), for a variation on the lexicon-based approach
* [Application](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0002716215569217) of a variation on the lexicon-based approach moving beyond polarity
* [Past workshop](http://static.lib.virginia.edu/statlab/materials/workshops/sentimentMaterials.zip) on sentiment analysis in R

There are other sources I'd point to for the machine learning approach, but as the algorithms are often built on specific corpora (e.g., social media, moview reviews, etc.), generalizability is always a question. Of course, generalizability is in quesiton for lexicons, as well, but lexicons are simpler to adapt for a domain/corpus-type. So let's start there.
