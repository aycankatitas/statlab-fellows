Task: 

I have started working on the first task, clean up readnews.R - what I'm thinking about doing is, depending on how we download new html from Lexis-Nexis, to put the newly downloaded files into a new folder and make DirSource() read only from that folder. Once those files are turned into corpus, delete the files in the new folder.
