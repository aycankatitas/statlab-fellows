* Consults: 
    * Darden PhD candidate; help selecting, implementing and interpreting statistical analyses for his dissertation. 
    * Econ PhD; had some survey data she collected and noticed that a particular response seemed to depend on who asked the question. Suggested she run a mixed-effect model to control for the variation between survey administrators.
    * surgery resident; has data on vascular surgeries, wants to investigate whether or not certain medications are helpful post-surgery. Data is in Excel, has imported to Stata, wants help cleaning data in Stata. Data is restricted and requires access to a server. He could not access server or even get on Internet while in Brown. (Iâ€™ve noticed this a lot with medical employees.) Referred him to Data@HSL.
