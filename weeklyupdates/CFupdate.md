* Admin:
    * Backed up Intro to R workshop. Always interesting to see what confuses new R users. This time someone was confusing objects in her global environment with files in her working directory. Totally understandable if you think about it.
* Consults:
    * McIntire faculty; asked for help scraping housing information from the UVa off-Grounds Housing Service web site. Wrote an R script to do this: https://gist.github.com/clayford/3ddaca6b4d4f3d2daf8d9a49c8fbc5a2
* Research/Learning:
    * Getting ready for 3 part data wrangling with R workshop series.

* Admin: fork statlab-fellows and sync public presidency repos; work with MPC to establish GitHub flow
* Consults: 
    * Darden PhD candidate; help selecting, implementing and interpreting statistical analyses for his dissertation. 
    * Econ PhD; had some survey data she collected and noticed that a particular response seemed to depend on who asked the question. Suggested she run a mixed-effect model to control for the variation between survey administrators.
    * surgery resident; has data on vascular surgeries, wants to investigate whether or not certain medications are helpful post-surgery. Data is in Excel, has imported to Stata, wants help cleaning data in Stata. Data is restricted and requires access to a server. He could not access server or even get on Internet while in Brown. (Iâ€™ve noticed this a lot with medical employees.) Referred him to Data@HSL.
* Research/Learning:
    * non-linear regression
    * neural networks
    * simulating data from binary logistic model
