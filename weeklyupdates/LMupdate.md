* Ideas for blog posts:
  * Similar to Yun Tai's posts, I could provide introductions to importing and using data, reshaping data, and combining data in R
  * I might provide an intro to ggplot in R, but perhaps with a particular subset or type of data or with a particular purpose in mind
  * Another idea would be to write posts about quanteda as I myself learn how to use it, so from a beginner's perspective to another beginner
  * Finally, this might be out of the StatLab's area of interest, but I could demonstrate how to do basic analysis and visualization in the software Tableau

* Task to take on:
  * To start better familiarizing myself with the dataset, I would like to "Run exploreNews.R and look for words, phrases that need to be normalized across the three newspapers" --should I comment something to that effect in the project_tasks.md?
