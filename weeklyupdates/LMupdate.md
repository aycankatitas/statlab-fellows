* Blog post:
  * Discovered there is a lot out there already about quanteda. Thinking I might tailor my blog post to be about one particular use? Or pull together what was useful to me from different sources? I don't want to repeat content, but still think the blog post could be useful
  
* Tweeted at NYT, WP, and WSJ to see if they have a publicaly available style guide--because why not!
   * Just running different checks might be the most possible solution on this
 
* Tried to implement boxr on readNews.R
  * Was returned with "empty directory" after the first initial commands seemed to work
* Tried to implement boxr on exploreNews.R
  * Says that there is an unexpected symbol
  * Maybe because R files aren't currently supported?

* Blog post: 
   * Using quanteda as a beginner
   * Using ggplot for a specific purpose
   
* Ran exploreNews.R and readNews.R
   * Wasn't able to find any other abbreviation differences, but "un" and "dot" might need to be differentiated by capitalization. Looked for "USA," "UN," "DOT," "USDA," "POTUS"
   * Wondering if it's possible to switch from a VCorpus to a PCorpus to speed up compilation?
   
* Explanation of other tasks during meeting?

* Ideas for blog posts:
  * Similar to Yun Tai's posts, I could provide introductions to importing and using data, reshaping data, and combining data in R
  * I might provide an intro to ggplot in R, but perhaps with a particular subset or type of data or with a particular purpose in mind
  * Another idea would be to write posts about quanteda as I myself learn how to use it, so from a beginner's perspective to another beginner
  * Finally, this might be out of the StatLab's area of interest, but I could demonstrate how to do basic analysis and visualization in the software Tableau

* Task to take on:
  * To start better familiarizing myself with the dataset, I would like to "Run exploreNews.R and look for words, phrases that need to be normalized across the three newspapers" --should I comment something to that effect in the project_tasks.md?
