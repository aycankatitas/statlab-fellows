####Research/Learning:
* Experimented with various options for the complexityNews.R to breakdown the corpus into corpus of sentences. I spent several hurs trying to get openNLP library on Rstudio but it had a dependency on rJava which was machine specific and could not be resolved. I also used tokenizer library to break into sentences but it only worked for simple corpus. Finally I was able to achieve the breakdown using 'tm' library by reshaping it but qmeta2 the docvarsof the parent gets copied as is to the sentence level and I am not sure if that makes sense like that. if not then I would need to reshape the docvars of the corpus too.
* I am also working on the blog which I exepect to be done over the weekend.

#### Consultations
Cindy : RA in economics department, Helped with reshaping the data using python
#### Research/Learning:
* learnt to use the pandas library to help cindy fix her problem by loading into the data frame and preprocessing the data of splitting the single row entry into multiple columns.
* Will be adding the things learnt to the blog as well
* Will continue to work on presidency project

#### Research/Learning:
* Almost done with complexity News. There are a few bugs to be fixed so will push the code once fixed.
* Researched quite a bit on the available libraries in python for the blog 
* Will continue to work on presidency project

#### Consultations
laura : doctoral student in Curry, Help with different factor analysis techniques
#### Research/ Learning:
created copies of files for complexityNews.R and ExploreNews.R that uses boxR for loading the files and creating the corpus objects. Continue to work on the reframing the corpus at the sentence level.
